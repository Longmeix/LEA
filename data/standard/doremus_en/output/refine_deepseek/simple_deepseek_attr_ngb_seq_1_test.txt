The world premiere of the Concertino was given by Ilona Kurz-Stepanova on February 16, 1926, in Brno, and later on February 20 in Prague. The information suggests that the composer, Janáček, initially thought about titling the suite "Printemps" and assigning animal-themed subtitles to each movement, such as "le hanneton" (the beetle), "le daim" (the roe deer), "le grillon" (the cricket), and "le ruisseau" (the brook).In a 1927 publication, Janáček offered another interpretation, associating specific instruments with different animals: the horn in the initial moderato movement was seen as representing a hedgehog, the clarinet in E-flat in the piu mosso movement as an squirrel, and the "con moto" movement as a dancing nocturne featuring owls and other night birds. The final allegro movement was envisioned as a general dance.The composition is praised for its unexpected modernism and has served as a reference for a generation of Soviet and Czech composers.

The emotional range of the suite is vast, oscillating between sudden love and passion to the dramatic and tragic, mirroring the emotional spectrum found in Goya's entire body of work.The suite initially comprised six pieces:1. Los Requiebros2. Coloquio en la Reja3. El Fandango del Candil4. Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruiseñor5. El Pelele6. El Amor y la Muerte7. Serenata del EspectroNotably, the piece "El Pelele" was not part of the original composition but was later composed and integrated into the collection.Granados held "Goyescas" in high regard and even adapted it into an opera, which was premiered in New York in January 1916, just a few weeks before his untimely death.

Mozart was very young when he first heard this instrument and was deeply fascinated by it. The opportunity to write for the glass harmonica came later in his life when Marianne Kirchgässner, a blind virtuoso of 21 years, visited Vienna during her European tour. This visit prompted Mozart to finally compose for the instrument, resulting in the quintet KV 617, which would become one of his last chamber music works.The title "Adagio et Rondo en ut mineur, pour harmonica de verre, flûte, hautbois, alto et violoncelle, adagio und rondo" provides additional context, indicating that the piece consists of an adagio and a rondo, both in the key of C minor.The relationship "ontology#u13 has casting" points to the specific instrumentation used in this expression of the work, which includes the glass harmonica, flute, oboe, viola, and cello.
